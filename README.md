===================================

Softwares Required:
1)  openJDK 17
https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/17

2) IntelliJ Ultimate edition 
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=mac


3) MySQL on Docker

Install Docker Desktop

Docker steps:

```
a) docker pull mysql

b) docker run --name local-mysql â€“p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Welcome123 -d mysql

container name given here is "local-mysql"

For Mac:
docker run -p 3306:3306 -d --name local-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Welcome123 mysql


c) CONNECT TO A MYSQL RUNNING CONTAINER:

$ docker exec -t -i local-mysql bash

d) Run MySQL client:

bash terminal> mysql -u "root" -p

mysql> exit

```

OOP : Object Oriented Paradigm

Writing programs which resemble real world.

Thinking in OOP.

Object first approach.
OBject is one which has state and behaviour.
State of the object is changed/mutate only by actions/messages/behaviour

Programming: template for Object 
function as template : JS
class as template: C++/ C# / Java
Type as template: Oracle

```
function Tv() {

}

class Tv {

}

Type Tv

End Tv
```

What messages an object can take is exposed thro its interface.
Remote for Tv
Switch and regulator for Fan
Remote for AC

================

SOLID Design Principle
S ==> Single Responsibility
O ==> Open Close Principle [ Component / Object is closed for change and open for extension]
L ==> Liskov Substitution Principle
Generalization and Specialization; A Specialized one can replace the generalized one to get the action of generalized one
I ==> Interface seggregation ==> Abstraction
Tv: 
HDMI interface to be used by objects like Settopbox, Laptop, Camera
Remote interface to be used by human object

BankingService Object:
Admin interface: can create account, see all transactions, block account
Customer interface: can view balance of account, transaction on his/her account, benificiary...

D ==> Dependency Injection
Inversion Of Control

==========================================

What is Java?
Java --> Technology

(Java Platform + API )--> where bytecodes are executed

Bytecodes are platform independent/ architecture neutral instructions
Example:
can run on my Macbook, windows, mobile, security camera, swipe machines,...

How to generate bytecode?
Generally we use different compilers based on choice of programming langauge
1) Java as programming langauge --> java compiler [javac]
2) Groovy --> groovy compiler
3) Kotlin --> Kotlin compiler

===================================

Account.java
```
    public class Account {
        private double balance; //state, instance variable

        public void deposit(double amt) {
            this.balance += amt;
        }

        public double getBalance() {
            return this.balance;
        }
    }
```

javac Account.java ---> Account.class [bytecode]
Account.class --> is portable [platform independent/ architecture]

AccountExample.java
```
    public class AccountExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Account rahulAcc = new Account(); 
            Account swethaAcc = new Account();
            rahulAcc.deposit(4500);
            swethaAcc.deposit(3600);

            System.out.println(rahulAcc.getBalance());
        }
    }
```

javac AccountExample.java ---> AccountExample.class [ bytecode ]

=====

Java Runtime Environment [JRE] --> on the target machine

java AccountExample <<return>>

1) Classloader: loads bytecode [.class files] from secondary storage [HDD] or Network [example settop box] to primary storage [RAM]
a) findLoadedClass()
b) loadClass() searchs for .class file in current folder and CLASSPATH 
set CLASSPATH=/users/project;/users/banu/mycode;.;
c) findSystemClass() --> built-in API
d) defineClass(): here .class is converted into platform specific datastructure; output of this is not portable


2) JVM: Java Virtual Machine
Metaspace
Stack
HeapArea

"new" is for DMA like malloc/calloc of "C"
