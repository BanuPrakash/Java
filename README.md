OOP : Object Oriented Paradigm

Writing programs which resemble real world.

Thinking in OOP.

Object first approach.
OBject is one which has state and behaviour.
State of the object is changed/mutate only by actions/messages/behaviour

Programming: template for Object 
function as template : JS
class as template: C++/ C# / Java
Type as template: Oracle

```
function Tv() {

}

class Tv {

}

Type Tv

End Tv
```

What messages an object can take is exposed thro its interface.
Remote for Tv
Switch and regulator for Fan
Remote for AC

================

SOLID Design Principle
S ==> Single Responsibility
O ==> Open Close Principle [ Component / Object is closed for change and open for extension]
L ==> Liskov Substitution Principle
Generalization and Specialization; A Specialized one can replace the generalized one to get the action of generalized one
I ==> Interface seggregation ==> Abstraction
Tv: 
HDMI interface to be used by objects like Settopbox, Laptop, Camera
Remote interface to be used by human object

BankingService Object:
Admin interface: can create account, see all transactions, block account
Customer interface: can view balance of account, transaction on his/her account, benificiary...

D ==> Dependency Injection
Inversion Of Control

==========================================

What is Java?
Java --> Technology

(Java Platform + API )--> where bytecodes are executed

Bytecodes are platform independent/ architecture neutral instructions
Example:
can run on my Macbook, windows, mobile, security camera, swipe machines,...

How to generate bytecode?
Generally we use different compilers based on choice of programming langauge
1) Java as programming langauge --> java compiler [javac]
2) Groovy --> groovy compiler
3) Kotlin --> Kotlin compiler

===================================

Account.java
```
    public class Account {
        private double balance; //state, instance variable; prefer making state as private

        // actions / messages/ methods/ behaviour ---> public
        public void deposit(double amt) {
            this.balance += amt;
        }

        public double getBalance() {
            return this.balance;
        }
    }
```

javac Account.java ---> Account.class [bytecode]
Account.class --> is portable [platform independent/ architecture]

AccountExample.java
```
    public class AccountExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Account rahulAcc = new Account(); 
            Account swethaAcc = new Account();
            rahulAcc.deposit(4500);
            swethaAcc.deposit(3600);

            System.out.println(rahulAcc.getBalance());
        }
    }
```

javac AccountExample.java ---> AccountExample.class [ bytecode ]

=====

Java Runtime Environment [JRE] --> on the target machine

java AccountExample <<return>>

1) Classloader: loads bytecode [.class files] from secondary storage [HDD] or Network [example settop box] to primary storage [RAM]
a) findLoadedClass()
b) loadClass() searchs for .class file in current folder and CLASSPATH 
set CLASSPATH=/users/project;/users/banu/mycode;.;
c) findSystemClass() --> built-in API
d) defineClass(): here .class is converted into platform specific datastructure; output of this is not portable


2) JVM: Java Virtual Machine
Metaspace
Stack
HeapArea

"new" is for DMA like malloc/calloc of "C"

https://www.artima.com/insidejvm/ed2/jvm.html

============

Logically grouping of objects/classes
* Entity classes: represent business data; they generally will be associated with persistent store like database / file / redis,..
Uber as example:
Customer.class
Driver.class
Car.class
Payment.class
Trip.class


Amazon:
Product, Customer, Order, Supplier, Payment, ...

* DAO classes: Data Access Object --> classes to perform CRUD operations on persistent store
CREATE READ UPDATE DELETE

* Service classes: Facade over DAO and business logic

* Exception classes : to represent any abnormal condition in application

* Utility classes : helper classes

* UI classes: User interface

============

in java we uses "packages" to logically group classes. packages are nothing but folders

constructors:
*special methods which has the same name as that of class; they are implicilty called when object is create, used to initialize the object. 
* no explicit return type
*Can't explictly call the constructor.
* can be overloaded; can have more than one
* Compiler creates default constructor, if we don't write any.

=================

Requirement:
need to have the count of how many accounts are created?

instance variable --> state of object
static variable --> state of class [ shared by all objects of a class]

local variables --> on stack
instance variables --> on heap
static variables --> on metaspace

============================================

Relationship between objects:
1) Generalization and Specialization --> IS A, achevied in programming using inheritance
2) Realization
3) Association --> "Has A" Relationship
4) Uses A


Checkstyle / PMD / Sonar / Jenkins ,...

CI / CD


Checkstyle <<static code analyzer>>: Naming Conventions and comments...
PMD / FindBug <<static code analyzer>>: Coding standards --> good programming practices

I keep Mobile in my Pocket which as Tata Sky Mobile app <<TV>>




"3G".equals(getConnectivity()) is preffered over. if connectivity is not set --> "3G".equals(null) --> false

getConnectivity().equals("3G"); --> can lead to NullPointerException if connectivity is not set.

===========

Product p = new Product();

Product p = new Mobile(); // valid ---> UpCasting

Product p = new Tv(); // valid ---> Upcasting


Product p = new Mobile(24, "iPhone 15", 89000.00, "5G"); 
// dynamic binding
p.isExpensive(); // call isExpensive() present in Mobile and not the one present in Product class

p.getName(); // valid

p.getConnectivity(); // Error, because Product can't send the message getConnectivity()

Mobile m = (Mobile)p; // downcasting
m.getConnectivity(); // 5G

===

```
Product p = new Mobile(24, "iPhone 15", 89000.00, "5G"); 

p instanceof Product ===> true

p instanceof Mobile ===> true

p instanceof Object ===> true

p instanceof Tv ===> false

p.getClass() == Mobile.class ===> true
p.getClass() == Product.class ===> false

```

abstract class
1) such a object doesn't exist in real world, just meant for generalization
like Account, Product
2) we can't instantiate abstract class

abstract methods: pure virtual functions [C++]
1) method without body; no implementation
2) when a base class has abstract methods, all inherited classes should compulsorily provide definitions of the abstract method; else that class also should be marked as abstract

Note:
1) abstract class need not have abstract methods.
2) if one of the method is abstract then class has to be declared as abstract

=============================

Realization relationship: based on contract

A component will realize the behavior specfied by other in order to communicate.

Realization relationship in OOP is acheived using interfaces

```
// contract
interface CustomerDao {
    void addCustomer(Customer c); // abstract methods
    Customer getCustomer(int id); // abstract method
}

all methods in interface are public and abstract by default
interfaces are like complete abstract class

// realization of contract <<implements>>

public class CustomerDaoMySQLImpl implements CustomerDao {
    // other state and behaviour

    public void addCustomer(Customer c) {
        // insert into ... SQL
    }

    public Customer getCustomer(int id) {
        ... SELECT from custoemrs ...
    }
}

// realization of contract <<implements>>
public class CustomerDaoFileImpl implements CustomerDao {
    // other state and behaviour

    public void addCustomer(Customer c) {
        // save to file
    }

    public Customer getCustomer(int id) {
        ... get from file ...
    }
}
```


Why Program to interface / contract?
1) DESIGN
based on user stories we create interface
register, login, home page should get all products, add to cart
2) IMPLEMENTATION
3) TESTING
4) INTEGRATION
5) LOOSE COUPLING

Entity --> interface --> implementation

entities and interfaces are shared to developers who implement them and call them.

Issues with below code:
  MobileDao mobileDao = new MobileDaoFileImpl();
     OR
  MobileDao mobileDao = new MobileDaoMySqlImpl();

  1) changes are done in client code, there could be many types of clients like standalone, web, mobile, Tv,....
  2) No abstraction. Why should client know about type of persistence

Solution:
Use factory methods

Using Configuration files for factory
========================

Classloader loads the class if its referenced directly in code

RealizationClient 
    loads String, MobileDao, MobileDaoFactory, Mobile, System


Programatically loading the class:

Class.forName("java.lang.String"); // loads String class into metaspace

Class.forName("java.util.Date");

Class.forName("com.adobe.prj.dao.MobileDaoMySQLImpl"); // loads the class into metaspace

----

Creating objects
1) if we know the class name in advance
String s = new String();

2) if we load class dynamically
Class.forName("com.adobe.prj.dao.MobileDaoMySQLImpl").getConstructor().newInstance();

```
    interface Swimable {
        swim();
    }

    interface Danceable {
        dance();
    }

    interface Fightable {
        fight();
    }

    // all actors are capable to dance
    class Actor implmenents Danceable {
         // state and behaviour
        dance() {
            ...
        }
    }

    // hero is a actor, and capable to dance, swim and fight
    class Hero extends Actor implements Swimable, Fightable {
        // state and behaviour
        fight() {

        }
        swim() {

        }
    }

// hero object is created, referenced by Fight interface
// just like Product p = new Mobile();
Fightable f = new Hero();
f.fight(); // valid
f.swim(); // Not valid; Stunt Master can direct only fight sequence of Hero

Swimable s = (Swimable) f;
s.swim(); // makes hero swim --> Swim Instructor

Danceble d = (Danceable) s;
d.dance(); // Choregrapher is directing dance sequence of Hero

```

* Java doesn't support multiple inheritance
* Object is the root class. every class extends Object
* class can implement multiple interfaces [ realization ]

=========================================================

Generic classes.

```
public class Rectangle {
    int width;
    int breadth;
    ///
}
Rectangle r1 = new Rectangle(3,5);

public class DRectangle {
    double width;
    double breadth;
    ///
}

DRectangle r1 = new DRectangle(3.3,1.5); 
Issue: too many classes, one for each type of data 

Solution: use generics

public class Rectangle<T> {
    T width;
    T breadth;
    ///
}

Rectangle<Integer> r1 = new Rectangle<Integer>(3,5);
Rectangle<Double> r2 = new Rectangle<Double>(1.3,4.5);
Rectangle<String> r3 = new Rectangle<String("A","B");

Note: Generics can't be primitive type
Rectangle<int> r1 = new Rectangle<int>(3,5); // error

Type Wrapper classes are used to convert primitive to Object type.
Integer is a type wrapper for int
Double is a type wrapper class for double.

int x = 100;
Integer iX = x; // boxing or wrapping

int y = iX; // unboxing or  unwrapping

```

Narrowing of the types:
```
public class Rectangle<T extends Number> {
    T width;
    T breadth;
    ///
}


Rectangle<Integer> r1 = new Rectangle<Integer>(3,5); //valid
Rectangle<Double> r2 = new Rectangle<Double>(1.3,4.5); // valid
Rectangle<String> r3 = new Rectangle<String("A","B"); // error
```

Generic method:

```
    public interface Computation<T> {
        T compute(T v1, T v2);
    }

    public class IntegerComputation implements Computation<Integer> {
        public Integer compute(Integer v1, Integer v2) {
            ...
        }
    }

     public class DoubleComputation implements Computation<Double> {
        public Double compute(Double v1, Double v2) {
            ...
        }
    }

```
interface, data containers, exception handling

Tasks for the Day:
1) Different types of Comments in Java
2) Naming conventions for Java: field, class, constants, methods

==========================================================================

Day 1 Recap:
OOP, JRE, Classloader, JVM, Stack, Metaspace, HeapArea
local variables --> stack
instance variables --> heap
static variables --> Metaspace where class definition is stored

new keyword is used to DMA --> instantiate objects and arrays
in heap area memory is allocated not only for state, it also contains header part --> hashcode, lock, classInfo,..

classInfo can be obtained using getClass() method of Object class.

Generalization and Specialization relationship --> Inheritance <<extends>>

super() to chain base class constructor, Overriding --> base class class already contains the method, we are not happy with the definition --> we override

Overloading is different from overriding
```
class Base {
    public int add(int x, int y) {
        return x + y;
    }
    // overloading
     public int add(int x) {
        return x + x;
    }
}

class Derived extends Base {
    // overloading
     public int add(int x, int y, int z) {
        return x + y + z;
    }
    // override
     public int add(int x, int y) {
        // code
        return x + y;
    }
}
```
abstract class and abstract methods, Reflection API {get methods of an object and invoke, create object without knowing class name}
Realization relationship --> interface <<implements>>

==============================

Day 2:

interface
* Anonymous class --> class created by JRE for abstract classes and interfaces

```
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

class Bird implements Flyable {
    String name;
    int age;
    // methods

    public void fly() {
        // logic
    }
}

class AeroPlane implements Flyable {
    String engine;
    String name;
    int capacity;
    // state and behaviour

    public void fly() {
        // logic
    }
}

class SomeClass1 implements Flyable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Jump from 12th floor with wings");
    }
}

class SomeClass2 implements Flyable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Jump from 24th floor with wings");
    }
}

```

Problem: too many classes in source code as well as in JVM: can lead to OutOfMemoryError <<too many classes loaded by classloader in Metaspace of JVM>>

Solution: Using Anonymous class or Lambda expression

```
    Flyable f1 = new Flyable(); // error, can't instantiate interface << also for abstract class>>

    Flyable f1 = new Flyable() {
        public void fly() {
            System.out.println("Jump from 24th floor with wings");
        };
    };
    // within JVM an anonymous class is created and object is created for anonymous class
    // once object is created, anonymous class is destroyed

    f1.fly(); // works fine

```

Functional Interface: interface with only one method to be implemented
Lambda expression can be used for FunctionalInterface.

Prefer Lambda if interface has only one method instead of Anonymous class from Java 8 version onwards.

=============

Built-in interface Comparable. 
Objects implementing this interface we can sort objects, find max, find min,...

==============================

Java Collection Frameworks --> provides data structures / containers
* interface
* implementation
* Algorithm classes

JCF can be used instead of arrays
Array has to be the first choice for data container.
Issues with array:
1) Size is fixed
2) can't grow nor shrink
3) adding / removing from arbitrary position is difficult --> O(n)
4) Contiguous memory

Comparable vs Comparator

Comparable is used to compare objects based on natural logic and logic is a part of object itself.

String --> has compareTo() based on which we compare strings --> Lexical
Product --> has compareTo() based on which we compared products ==> price

Comparator is used to compare objects based on clients requirements and logic is part of client.


Arrays: built in algorthim class can be used to find max, min, sort, ... operations on array type of a container based on Comparable or Comparator interface --> Similar to Util.java what we wrote.

List vs Set
List:
1) ordered collection
2) can contain duplicate elements
3) supports index based operation --> add(5, "a"), get(6);, remove(10); ...
4) can be re-ordered --> sort, shuffle, reverse, ...

Set:
1) unique collection
2) not suppors re-ordering or index based operations

List is preffered over array to overcome the limitations of array

Vector and Stack are legacy implemnetations of List interface, not supposed to be used because operations are very slow.
Reason: every operation needs a thread to acquire a lock

for List preffered implmentation classes are 
1) ArrayList --> Java
2) LinkedList --> Java
3) Apache Collections
4) VAVR collection

ArrayList (95% usage) vs LinkedList
ArrayList is like Array but can grow or shrink
LinkedList is doubly linked list

-----------

Different ways of using List data container
1) ArrayList list = new ArrayList(); 
// avoid --> heterogenous container --> Not type safe
list.add("A");
list.add(34);
list.add(new Date());

to access we need to do type checking

if(list.get(i) instanceof Date) {
    Date d = (Date) list.get(i);
}

// always program to interface

2) List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();  // use genrerics for type safety
list.add("Anna"); // works
list.add(new Date()); // compilation error
// typesafe

String s = list.get(0);

===

Stream --> introduced in Java 8 version
A stream represents a sequence of elements and supports different operations (Filter, Sort, Map, and Collect) from a collection or file or network or database stream source.

HOF --> High Order Functions (filter, map, reduce, collect, limit, skip, forEach, ...)
* HOF is one which can take function as argument
* HOF is also a function which can return a function

filter --> to get sub-set
map --> to transform the data
reduce --> to get aggregate like [sum, count, avg, total]
collect --> to collect the output of stream in other container
forEach --> traverse thro output of stream operation

```
filter(predicateFn) {
    container;
    for every elem in source
        if(predicateFn(elem))
            add to container
    end for

    return container
}
```

We can have many HOF chained for a stream, but the last operation has to be a terminal operation [collect, forEach, reduce]

=======================================

Set 
 |
 HashSet
 |
 TreeSet

HashSet data container is a implementation of Set interface, for unique collection.
HashSet uses hashCode() and equals() to identify duplicate elements and also for ordering elements.

What is HashCode?
* Numerical value of object generally based on state of object
* if 2 objects are similar then their hashcodes has to be same
* possibility is 2 dissimilar objects can also have same hashcode.

Hashcode of every object is stored in header part [heap area] 

public class Object {
    int hashCode(); // gives address of object; not good; we need to override
}
// Bad hashCode example
```
public class Rectangle {
    w, b;

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return w * b;
    }
}
lots of collision
Rectangle r1 = new Rectangle(4,5); // hashcode --> 20
Rectangle r2 = new Rectangle(5,4); // hashcode --> 20
Rectangle r3 = new Rectangle(10,2); // hashcode --> 20
Rectangle r4 = new Rectangle(20,1); // hashcode --> 20
Rectangle r5 = new Rectangle(1,20); // hashcode --> 20
```

Hashbased data containers uses HashCode
HashSet, Hashtable, HashMap uses it


Map is a data container which stores data in the form of Key/value pair
Examples: Dictionary, registry
key has to be unique, can have duplicate values
